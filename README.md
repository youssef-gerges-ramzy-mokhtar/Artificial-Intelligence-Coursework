# Artificial-Intelligence-Coursework

## A University Artificial Intelligence Coursework that consists of mainly 2 parts:
  1. Implementing a K-Nearest Classifier
  2. Implementing a Genetic Algorithm to perform a regression

## Dataset Description (to be contd...)
  1. // describe the amounts of training and validation data
  2. state that the data are just points in 3d space
  3. State that every point has either a label of 1 or -1
  4. describe the purpose of the 4 types of files

## K-Nearest Classifier (to be contd...)
  1. // which .py file
  2. how to run the code
  3. what is expected out of this code
  4. give a screenshoot

## Genetic Algorithm (to be contd...)
  1. // which .py file
  2. how to run the code
  3. what is expected out of this code
  5. maybe give more info about what does the genetic algorithm do and the required task
  6. give a screenshoot

## Additional Notes (to be contd...)
  1. describe the purpose of the boundry.py file
  2. state to refer to the Report for further technical details
