# Artificial-Intelligence-Coursework

## A University Artificial Intelligence Coursework that consists of mainly 2 parts:
  1. Implementing a K-Nearest Classifier
  2. Implementing a Genetic Algorithm to perform a regression

## Dataset Description
  1. The dataset consists of 900 labeled data points. Of these, 360 are for training and 540 are for validation
  2. Each data point denotes a location in 3D space, represented by coordinates (x, y, z)
  3. Every data point has either a label of 1 or -1
  4. There are 4 files for the dataset
     + training_set - contains the (x, y, z) coordinates of all points in the training set
     + training_labels - contains the labels of each data point in the training set, either 1 or -1
     + validation_set - contains the (x, y, z) coordinates of all points in the validation set
     + validation_labels - contains the labels of each data point in the validation set, either 1 or -1

## K-Nearest Classifier (to be contd...)
  1. // which .py file
  2. how to run the code
  3. what is expected out of this code
  4. give a screenshoot

## Genetic Algorithm (to be contd...)
  1. // which .py file
  2. how to run the code
  3. what is expected out of this code
  5. maybe give more info about what does the genetic algorithm do and the required task
  6. give a screenshoot

## Additional Notes (to be contd...)
  1. describe the purpose of the boundry.py file
  2. state to refer to the Report for further technical details
